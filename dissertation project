# MSc Dissertation: Bayesian Modelling in Longitudinal Health Data

## Overview
This project explores the application of three Bayesian computation methods — MCMC, INLA, and Variational Bayes — for analysing large longitudinal and survival datasets. Conducted as part of my MSc Health Data Science at the University of Liverpool.

## Objective
To compare performance in terms of estimation accuracy, computational efficiency, and uncertainty quantification using simulated and real-world health data.

## Methods & Tools
- R (JMbayes, rstan, INLA)
- Statistical Methods: Joint Modelling, MCMC, INLA, Variational Bayes
- Diagnostics: Trace plots, autocorrelation, posterior summaries

## Key Findings
- MCMC was most accurate but computationally intensive
- INLA offered fast, approximate results ideal for latent Gaussian models
- VB was fastest but underestimated uncertainty in posterior estimates
